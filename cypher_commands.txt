# Step 1. Load from CSV file into neo4j. The csv file must be placed in the import directory
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'fileName.csv' CREATE (:Athlete ​​)

# Step 2. For number or date types,Convert the data type of an attribute:
match (n:Athlete)
SET n.Height = toInteger(n.Height)

match (n:Athlete)
SET n.Year = toInteger(n.Year)

match (n:Athlete)
SET n.Weight = toInteger(n.Weight)

match (n:Athlete)
SET n.Age = toInteger(n.Age)


#step 3 (optional) filter data
#create a project in neo4j. A project can hold multiple databases.
#Clone the first database to a new database and filter down the result based on an attribute

match (n:Athlete)
where n.Medal CONTAINS 'NA'
return n;

#Verifty this returns all the nodes where there was no medal.
# Can delete these nodes from the cloned database. Leaves a database with just the medalists

match (n:Athlete)
where n.Medal CONTAINS 'NA'
delete n;

# this will leave 39 nodes - all the medalists for 52 years of one event.


#step 4 - create relationships for data
# dont do this exactly.. we need to think of how to build the relationships
MATCH (a:Athlete),(b:Athlete)
WHERE a.NOC = 'USA' AND b.NOC = 'USA'
CREATE (a)-[r:RelationName]->(b)
RETURN type(r), r.name
